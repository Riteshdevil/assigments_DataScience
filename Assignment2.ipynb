    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Ans.: There are 2 types of boolean data- True and False. While writing code we write as following : \n",
    "        flag = True\n",
    "        flag1 = False.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans. : Boolean operators : AND, OR, NOT\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean\n",
    "values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "Ans. : AND :\n",

    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a\n",
    "condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Ans. : For comparing 2 values we have to use equals to operator (==)\n",
    "        Eg. : 3==3\n",
    "       For assigning value to a variable we use assigment operator (=)\n",

    "Ans : Defintion for range function is range(start, stop, [step]) where start and step criteria is optional\n",
    "    If only stop is mentioned then loop starts from 0 by default and step value is by default 1.\n",
    "    For second and third function start and step criteria is mentioned but the output produced by all three is same which is 0 tp 9 as range starts values from 0 to stop-1.\n",
